But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of 
denouncing of a pleasure and praising pain was born and I w
ill give you a complete account of the system, and expound the a
ctual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human ha

ppiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, 
but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences 
that are extremely painful. Nor again is there an

yone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, b
ecause it is pain, but occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and p
ain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever un
dertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage
 from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who choose
 s to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one
  who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?
